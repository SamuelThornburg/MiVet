<h3>MiVet is a platform with a mission to modernize the relationship between horse owners and equine veterinarians.</h3>

<p>My role as for this project was to create and manage a newsfeed feature. Below is a broad overview of the work that I completed.</p>

● Generated relational database in SQL allowing newsfeed data to be manipulated by users and administrators through the user interface

● Designed custom models, domains, interfaces services, and API endpoints using .NET Core framework to connect front end and back-end functionality

● Designed components in React.js to maximize aesthetics and functionality.

● Utilized Agile methodology by effectively communicating goals and blockers during daily standups and code functionality during code reviews

● Implemented server and client-side data validation using tools from various React libraries such as prop-types, Yup and Formik packages and the inherent Microsoft component models in .NET Core

● Utilized GitHub as source control among team members to ensure code quality, continuity, and ensure code consistency when conducting pull requests

● Utilized Postman to efficiently test and iterate APIs by creating HTTP requests
